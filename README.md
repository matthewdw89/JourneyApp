# JourneyApp
Journey is an app that is used for travelers to find other travelers, whether in their current location or in a destination they are heading. You will create an account, sign in, and then once signed in it will search for others within a 50km radius using the app. You can then view their profiles, message them directly and orangise to travel together or just to meet up. 

## Motivation
I personally travel a lot, and sometimes its hard to find other travelers to go explore a new country or city with. I have also meet travelers that are introverts that find it hard to talk to people when they are traveling. This app is to create a community that will introduce all kinds of people and to be able to share the joys of traveling together.
